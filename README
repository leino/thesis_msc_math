My thesis project for MSc in Mathematics, presented on November 2011.


In the report, I write about the Quillen-Suslin theorem.
Suslin gave an almost constructive proof of this.
The non-constructive portion is contained in Lemma 5.10.
This proof makes use of maximal ideals, which is not constructive in general.

In the final chapter, a very general version of this lemma is proved constructively.

In the 'code' subdirectory, there is also code corresponding to the constructive proof of Lemma 5.10.
The implementation looks a lot like the non-constructive proof, thanks to it's use of the continuation monad.

(The custom monad defined in 'DynamicIdeal.hs' allows you to pretend that you are working modulo a maximal ideal,
and thus allows you to compute inverses. Behind the scenes, the "maximal ideal" keeps changing as you request
inverses of elements. Thus I named it a "dynamic ideal". Feel free to criticize the name.)

In the future, I plan to implement Quillen-Suslin fully.
